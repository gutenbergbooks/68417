</div>


<p>Every play in this series has been written by a
member of the Play-Writing Class at Vassar College.
But each play as printed is the product of a
group-activity. Not merely an individual seated at
a desk, but a community working together in a
theater, is responsible for it in its final form.</p>

<p>Some of these plays have been “tried out” by the
Vassar Dramatic Workshop and some by the Community
Theatre of Poughkeepsie, New York. By
the coöperative efforts of all who were associated in
these enterprises—actors, committee workers and
financial supporters—these plays have been given a
sympathetic and intelligent production before audiences
also intelligent and sympathetic, whose reaction
has afforded the writers much valuable criticism.
In the preliminary readings and rehearsals,
also, occasional weak points which had escaped the
ordeal of class criticism came to light and were
strengthened by the author’s revision. In fact, the
plays as they appear in this series are literally a collaboration
of the writers with innumerable friendly
critics in the play-writing class, the cast and the audience.
And it would be ungracious to put the fruits
of this collaboration at the service of the public without
grateful acknowledgment to all those who have
in any way helped to establish and carry on the Vassar
Dramatic Workshop or the Community Theatre
of Poughkeepsie.</p>

<p>In recent years there has been an increasing demand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
for well-written, dramatically effective one-act
plays, suitable for production by semi-professional
companies or by amateur organizations of serious
purpose and some degree of training. To aid in
supplying this demand is the purpose of the Vassar
Series of Plays. Other plays written by members
of the Play-Writing Class at Vassar College may be
secured in typewritten form by application to The
Workshop Bureau of Plays, Vassar College.</p>

<p>All the plays in this series are protected by copyright.
A royalty of five dollars for each production
must be paid to Samuel French, 28-30 West 38th
Street, New York City, at least one week before the
date of the performance.</p>

PRODUCING THE PLAY</h2></div>


<p>The beautiful Swedish national costumes should
be used for this play. Any good reference book on
the costumes of various nations and many books
about travel in Sweden will furnish illustrations
that may be copied, varying the colors when necessary
to produce a harmonious relation with one
another. Since this is a modern play, only the servants,
who are, of course, peasants, would be likely
to wear these costumes on ordinary occasions, but
members of the upper classes sometimes assume
them for the festivities of the Christmas season.
We may, therefore, take advantage of this possibility,
to increase the picturesqueness of our play
by using the colorful Swedish dress for all the characters.</p>

<p>A real Swedish interior, carefully reproduced from
trustworthy illustrations, would also be effective.
Not all the furniture found in any illustration should,
of course, be used for the stage setting. A few
pieces only should be chosen, with a view to composing
without unnecessary “clutter” into a beautiful
and characteristically Swedish whole.</p>

<p>The lines of this play are exceptionally simple in
their phrasing and yet so full of meaning that no
word or syllable should be lost by the audience. An
intelligent, sympathetic rendering of each speech is
especially important, but clear-cut enunciation and
a beautiful quality of voice are also very desirable,
particularly for Olga, Liljekrona and the two children.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span></p>

<p>Olga is obviously the very heart of this play. She
makes a charming picture with the little boys over
the Christmas tree, the candle-lighting in the windows,
and the story of the Christ-Child’s wanderings.
Her tender love for her home and her instinctive
fear of any influence which may tend to lower
its ideals or to draw Liljekrona away from it, must
be so clearly brought out in the acting (as it is in
the lines) that the audience will understand and
even partially sympathize with her anxiety to be rid
of the drunken vagrant, Ruster.</p>

<p>This anxiety is sharpened by the approach of the
Christmas season, which she feels should be celebrated
as a beautiful home festival, just by themselves.
But even as Olga carries her point and
Ruster is about to leave the house, she is assailed
by remorse for the selfish impulse to protect her
home at the unfortunate old man’s expense. This
should be clearly indicated in the tone and manner
with which she asks Liljekrona to give Ruster something
extra for Christmas and to lend him his fur
coat.</p>

<p>The departure of Ruster ends the first stage of
the play’s action, in which Olga has attempted to
secure happiness for herself and her household by
the refusal of her hospitality to some one in sore
need of it. Ruster had seemed to her a discordant
element when present, but his absence seems to
bring ten-fold more unhappiness. All the Christmas
preparations go wrong. Sigurd’s cookie-dough figure
of the Christ-Child “doesn’t look like anything,”
the E string of Liljekrona’s fiddle has snapped and
he has no new one, Torstein has gone to drive Ruster
and they cannot dance without him, the sheaves for
the sparrows have been forgotten, and finally Liljekrona
withdraws to his own room to play the stormy
music which Olga understands as a portent of his
return to the old life of wandering.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span></p>

<p>In this section of the play, Liljekrona controls
the action and should dominate the scene. Olga attempts,
in vain, to infuse joy into the Christmas
observances. Liljekrona’s bitterly self-reproachful
speech about the lonely and the hungry people,—“When
they pass so close as to touch our sleeve,—we
do not see them, we do not stop them, but let
them plod their path alone,”—shows that he will no
longer deceive himself as to the heartlessness of
their own action. And when he says—“Your candles
are too late. The door is closed. The voice is
gone,”—Olga sees that on the eve of Christmas and
in the name of its fitting observance, she has betrayed
its very spirit of hospitality and kindness.</p>

<p>The sound of the music from Liljekrona’s room,
full of the old, wild passion for the open road,
brings to Olga realization of the price she must pay
for this mistake, “if God does not work a miracle in
the night.” Her intense suffering at this point marks
the crucial moment in the play and must be conveyed
by action and facial expression as well as by
a poignant rendering of the lines. The moment
must be held perceptibly, after she sinks into her
chair, until the sound of sleighbells, at first far off
and gradually approaching, breaks the spell.</p>

<p>The bells usher in the third stage of the action,
which is markedly different in feeling-tone from
the other two. Instead of the fear and the cloaked
unkindness of the first scene and the growing self-reproach
of the second, we have the exaltation of
complete surrender to generous impulse. Olga’s
joy in the “miracle” which she so little deserved or
expected must shine from her face and from every
word and action, as soon as she realizes that Ruster
has indeed returned and she has a chance to repair
the wrong she has done. Her inspiration to ask
Ruster to look after the children while she is out of
the room should be so acted as to show that there is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
something behind her simple request. She will
prove her gratitude for this chance to atone, by
trusting her dearest treasures to the man she had
feared to have remain in the house with them.</p>

<p>The scene of the children with Ruster gives the
actor an opportunity to show the battered, dissipated
old man, afraid of the innocent eyes of the children,
but gradually put at his ease by their complete unconsciousness
and their real interest in the one thing
he knows,—flute-playing. Ruster’s complete collapse
when the children’s absorption in reading allows
him to realize his own desolate situation, and
Olga’s offer to make him their tutor, need only be
played with entire simplicity and sincerity by both
actors, to bring tears to the eyes of many people in
the audience.</p>

<p>Olga’s explanation to Liljekrona of her plans for
Ruster and why she is taking this great risk, bring
her once more into a position of leadership. This is
emphasized by the action, as first Liljekrona, then
the children and finally Ruster, kiss Olga’s hand,
while her curtain speech to Ruster gives the needed
touch of humility and graciousness to her exaltation.</p>

<p>The curtain should be raised quickly after it has
been lowered, so as to make the tableau of the lighting
of the tree seem, as it is, an essential part of the
play.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="hangin0"><span class="smcap">Scene</span>: <span class="dir">The living-room of</span> <span class="smcap">Lofdala</span>, <span class="dir">a Swedish
manor house. It is the afternoon before Christmas
and the room has an atmosphere of comfort
and warmth; outside it is snowing. To the
left is a large Swedish fireplace, with its hanging
black chimney-hood, crane and shining kettles.
A high wooden bench, a table and armchair
are drawn close to the fire. A heavy, iron-hinged
door opens outdoors at the center back.
On either side are windows. At the left a door
leads into the kitchen, and at the right a flight
of stairs leads to the bedrooms. By the stairs
stands a Christmas tree as yet unlighted. There
is a music cabinet against the back wall, left;
and an oblong table at the right; a carved
wooden chest stands beside the fireplace.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Time</span>: <span class="dir">about 1890</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Olga</span> <span class="dir">is discovered arranging candles on the
tree. She is slender and moderately tall, with
large eyes and rich dark hair braided about her
head. She wears Swedish holiday dress.</span></p>

<p class="hangin">(<span class="dir">Enter</span> <span class="smcap">Oswald</span> <span class="dir">and</span> <span class="smcap">Sigurd</span>, <span class="dir">running downstairs
with their hands full of cotton. They are six
and four years old</span>, <span class="smcap">Oswald</span> <span class="dir">being a little the
taller. They are bright-faced, tow-headed little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
boys, and are dressed in their embroidered holiday
suits.</span> <span class="smcap">Oswald</span> <span class="dir">stops halfway down, and
leaning over the banisters drops bits of cotton
on the tree</span>.)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Oswald.</span> See, Mother, it’s snowing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sigurd.</span> Look, Mother—it’s snowing. (<span class="dir">Turns at
the foot of the stairs and runs back to</span> <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oswald.</span> Don’t make such big flakes, Sigurd.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sigurd.</span> But I’m making it snow hard.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oswald.</span> Oh, look, that fell on a candle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Olga.</span> We need some more snow over here.
Come down and make it snow on these branches.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oswald.</span> But, Mother, we need some most on
this side—like this.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sigurd.</span> Where is Father?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Olga.</span> He has gone out with Torstein in the
sledge to gather green boughs to make the house
look like Christmas.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sigurd.</span> It’ll soon be Christmas, Mother. When
can we light the candles?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Olga.</span> When Father comes home. Have we
used up all the snow, Oswald?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oswald.</span> Yes, I will get some more. (<span class="dir">Starts
upstairs.</span>) Oh! (<span class="dir">Draws back as he discovers</span> <span class="smcap">Ruster</span>,
<span class="dir">who has just entered and is standing on the
landing. He is unkempt and his shabby, black coat
is buttoned up to his chin. His eyes are small and
blurred and his dark hair stands out like a cloud
about his head. But he is not wholly unattractive.
His features are well-formed and his black mustache
is twirled at a proud angle. He carries his music
pen and manuscript. His voice is cracked and
harsh.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Olga.</span> (<span class="dir">Looking up</span>) Why, Ruster!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruster.</span> (<span class="dir">Shivering</span>) I thought you might be
having punch. My bones are frozen working up in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
that cold room. It would take a taste of hell-fire to
warm me up. (<span class="dir">Drinking from his flask.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Olga.</span> (<span class="dir">Turning toward the boys—raising her
hand as if to silence</span> <span class="smcap">Ruster</span>) The punch has not
been made yet, Ruster. Children, have you forgotten
your Christmas cookies? Halla will help you
make them if you run out to her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oswald.</span> Oh, I know what I want to make.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sigurd.</span> What, Oswald?—What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oswald.</span> I want a raisin in mine. (<span class="dir">Pushing open
the door.</span>) Can I, Halla?</p>

<p class="center">(<span class="dir">Exeunt to kitchen.</span> <span class="smcap">Olga</span> <span class="dir">crosses to</span> <span class="smcap">Ruster</span>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Olga.</span> If you are cold, Ruster, why not stay
here by the fire and copy your music? Is there
much more to do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruster.</span> (<span class="dir">Seating himself and arranging pages</span>)
Liljekrona says there is no hurry. When will he be
home?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Olga.</span> As soon as he has filled the sledge with
boughs, for he knows we need him here on Christmas
Eve. (<span class="dir">She goes to the window. Sleighbells are
heard.</span>) There they are, coming up the drive. We
must have some place to put the branches. (<span class="dir">She
spreads a cloth on the floor.</span> <span class="smcap">Ruster</span> <span class="dir">steals a drink
from his flask. The door opens. Enter</span> <span class="smcap">Liljekrona</span>.
<span class="dir">He is a tall, finely erect man, clad in a heavy
fur coat that is covered with snow. As he takes off
his cap, he discloses a mass of light hair brushed
back from an unusually high forehead. His face
is at once sensitive and strong. He carries a load
of boughs.</span>) Well, what an armful you have!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Liljekrona.</span> (<span class="dir">Gaily</span>) Tell the children I have
brought home the whole forest for our Christmas.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Olga.</span> Put down your forest over here. Was
it very cold?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Liljekrona.</span> There has been a fine flurry all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
morning. (<span class="smcap">Olga</span> <span class="dir">helps him off with his coat</span>.) But
the fire feels good!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruster.</span> This is the warmest place in the house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Liljekrona.</span> How is it going? (<span class="dir">Looking over</span>
<span class="smcap">Ruster’s</span> <span class="dir">shoulder</span>.) You haven’t forgotten how a
page ought to look, have you, Ruster?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruster.</span> No, I can copy, but I cannot play. I
have almost forgotten the sound of my flute. Nobody
wants a flute-player nowadays! They do not
care for music any more in Varmland and they do
not want to learn.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Liljekrona.</span> Yes, Varmland is not like Ekeby
when we knew it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruster.</span> It’s a pity we ever left there, Liljekrona!
We have never had such playing since—you
with your violin and I with my flute. Old Torwaldson
waving his angry stick! By Heaven, he
called the souls out of us!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Liljekrona.</span> Yes, the violins sobbing—then the
horns, the winds, the basses—each breaking over the
other in thundering waves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruster.</span> Holy Mother!—that was living!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Liljekrona.</span> And from one patron off on the
road to another, and along the way, what gay evenings
in the tent and at the inn when a man was
free from care!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruster.</span> How you could play then! Shall I forget
that night in Olaf’s garden? You made your
fiddle sing as though your heart were in tune with
its strings. But now, Christ’s blood! you never play
like that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Olga.</span> He plays more beautifully now than he
ever did at Ekeby.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Liljekrona.</span> No, there is not so much time for
practice here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruster.</span> And the old spirit has gone out of you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Liljekrona.</span> I sometimes think so myself. It is
hard to settle down after a life of wandering.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
Something wild keeps crying in my soul, bidding me
be off again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Olga.</span> Why is not home the place for music,
Liljekrona? Surely those who love you most care
most to hear. Must you seek your inspiration from
strangers?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Liljekrona.</span> No, Olga, you are more to me than
a world of strangers. It is you alone who hold me
here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruster.</span> Yes—you have a warm fire and a full
cellar to keep you at home. (<span class="smcap">Liljekrona</span> <span class="dir">shrugs
and turns away impatiently</span>.) But what about the
man who has not money enough to fill his flask?
(<span class="dir">Bitterly.</span>) My horse, and carriole, and fur coat—they’re
all gone! (<span class="dir">Drinks, then laughs boisterously.</span>)
But still I have friends—lots of friends in Varmland,
and they’re always glad to see me and give me a
cup of cheer! (<span class="dir">He drains his flask and wipes his
mustache with the back of his hand.</span> <span class="smcap">Liljekrona</span>
<span class="dir">rises disgustedly and crosses the room</span>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Olga.</span> (<span class="dir">Pointedly</span>) Have you more copying to

<p><span class="smcap">Ruster.</span> (<span class="dir">Blinking at her</span>) The “Folksong” is
almost finished. I was thinking, Liljekrona—that
when that is done, there are two others you showed
me yesterday, that would go well with this.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Liljekrona.</span> It is better alone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruster.</span> But those two shepherd songs. I took
the book to my room. Wait till I bring it down.
(<span class="dir">He rises unsteadily. Exit.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Olga.</span> (<span class="dir">Going to</span> <span class="smcap">Liljekrona</span>) Liljekrona,
don’t give him more copying, or we shall be obliged
to keep him over Christmas.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Liljekrona.</span> He must be somewhere.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Olga.</span> Our Christmas is spoiled if he stays. He
is so dirty and he drinks so. And think how bad it
is for the children.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Liljekrona.</span> But he is an old friend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Olga.</span> Yet on Christmas Eve—we have kept
thinking how happy we should be, telling stories
and dancing about the tree. And you would play
our favorite tunes. (<span class="dir">She looks wistfully about the
partly decorated room.</span>) But now all the pleasure
is gone if Ruster stays!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Liljekrona.</span> Formerly you were glad to see him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Olga.</span> Yes—we all were. But not since he has
become a drunkard. And, Liljekrona, I am
afraid——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Liljekrona.</span> Afraid of what, dear?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Olga.</span> (<span class="dir">Impetuously</span>) Let him go somewhere
else for Christmas.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Liljekrona.</span> How can we send him away? It
would be inhospitable. Nobody wants him any more
than we do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Olga.</span> But the children, Liljekrona.</p>

<p class="center">(<span class="dir">Enter</span> <span class="smcap">Ruster</span> <span class="dir">with book</span>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Liljekrona.</span> Yes, I remember.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruster.</span> Shall I copy them?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Liljekrona.</span> No—I can play these from the
book.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruster.</span> This is a poor transcription. It should
be written in D instead of F.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Liljekrona.</span> Well, I can transpose it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruster.</span> I have not copied the words for the
“Folksong.” Do you want it done?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Liljekrona.</span> No, it will do as it is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruster.</span> Well then, it is finished. (<span class="dir">Half-heartedly.</span>)
I suppose I must be going. (<span class="dir">Glances toward
the window.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Liljekrona.</span> (<span class="dir">Indifferently</span>) You had better
stay where you are over Christmas.</p>

mean, Liljekrona, shall I stay here because I have
nowhere else to go? Why, only think how they
are standing and waiting for me in the big ironworks
in the parish of Bro. The guest-room will
be already in order and the glass of welcome filled.
I must hurry. I only do not know to whom I
should go first.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Liljekrona.</span> Very well, you may go if you will.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruster.</span> (<span class="dir">Emphatically</span>) Yes, I must go—at
once.</p>

<p class="center">(<span class="dir">Enter</span> <span class="smcap">Torstein</span> <span class="dir">with logs for the fire</span>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Torstein.</span> Yes, Ma’am.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Olga.</span> Then bring the sledge around.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruster.</span> And bring it at once. I have only to
get my treasures and I am ready. (<span class="dir">Picks up his

<p><span class="smcap">Oswald.</span> Then, Mother, if Sigurd and I made
some good cookies, could we take them down to those
poor children?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Olga.</span> If only we knew just where we could
find them, Oswald. It is hard sometimes to know
where the lonely people are, and the hungry ones.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Liljekrona.</span> And when they pass so close as to
touch our sleeve on the way we do not see them, we
do not stop them, but let them plod their path alone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Olga.</span> (<span class="dir">Stung by</span> <span class="smcap">Liljekrona’s</span> <span class="dir">remark</span>) It is

<p><span class="smcap">Liljekrona.</span> Torstein is not back yet. He is

the house. (<span class="dir">Goes to the window.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Olga.</span> Well then, we’ll wait our dancing for

<p><span class="smcap">Liljekrona.</span> The sparrows are twittering about

<p><span class="smcap">Olga.</span> I did not think of it till now. Did you

Sigurd, do you know why we put candles in the
windows on Christmas Eve?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oswald.</span> So that people can see where we live!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Olga.</span> Yes—dear; and there is a story that the

<p><span class="smcap">Ruster.</span> (<span class="dir">Rising, alarmed</span>) I can’t do that!—Why,
I—they——</p>

steady gaze of the children, restrains himself
and fumbles in his pocket. He draws out his
flute and blows a note on it. The boys come
closer.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oswald.</span> How do you do that? (<span class="smcap">Ruster</span> <span class="dir">does
not answer, but blows again</span>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sigurd.</span> Why do you lift your fingers?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruster.</span> To make the notes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sigurd.</span> Let me try! (<span class="smcap">Ruster</span> <span class="dir">places his little
fingers over two of the stops</span>. <span class="smcap">Sigurd</span> <span class="dir">blows, but no
sound comes</span>. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span> <span class="dir">laughs</span>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oswald.</span> Let <em>me</em> try! (<span class="smcap">Ruster</span> <span class="dir">shows him also—but
still no tone</span>.) How do you do it? (<span class="dir">He tries
again.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruster.</span> I blow in here. (<span class="dir">Showing them.</span>) And
I keep the holes covered with my fingers. When I
want to make a note, I lift up a finger, like this.
(<span class="dir">He blows.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sigurd.</span> Blow another.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruster.</span> (<span class="dir">Blows another. Then both over again</span>)
This is A and this is B.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oswald.</span> A and B. You can’t play <em>them</em>.
They’re letters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruster.</span> Yes, and in music they are the names
of the notes. (<span class="dir">Takes out a score and with a crayon
makes a few notes.</span>) This is the way they look.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sigurd.</span> Let me see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oswald.</span> No! That’s not right! That’s not
what’s in our storybook! See—I’ll show you. (<span class="dir">He
runs to music cabinet, and from lower cupboard
pulls out a battered cloth book.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruster.</span> (<span class="dir">To</span> <span class="smcap">Sigurd</span>) Can this boy spell his
name?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sigurd.</span> Yes—S I G U R D!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oswald.</span> See—look at <em>our</em> book. There isn’t
any A and B like that! That is A and that is B.

badly!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruster.</span> (<span class="dir">Sobbing softly</span>) Yes—I am of no use
any more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Olga.</span> (<span class="dir">Sympathetically</span>) I know—I know.
You cannot make a living by your music and you
are destroying yourself with brandy. You have
been turned away from every door where you have
knocked. But, Ruster——</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruster.</span> Yes, I am worn out. I ought to be
thrown away! Nobody needs me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Olga.</span> But don’t you see that to be with the
children, as to-night, would be something for you?
If you would teach children you would be welcomed
everywhere. Look at them, Ruster! (<span class="dir">She places
the boys in front of him.</span>) Look at them!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruster.</span> (<span class="dir">Blinking</span>) I dare not!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Olga.</span> (<span class="dir">Laughing joyously</span>) Then you must
accustom yourself to them, Ruster! Perhaps you
could help them with their reading. They need a
schoolmaster! (<span class="dir">Turning to children triumphantly.</span>)
How would you like that, children?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Olga.</span> (<span class="dir">Beaming</span>) Yes, and he is going to stay
with us to teach our little boys.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Liljekrona.</span> Ruster! (<span class="dir">With amazement</span>) You
have asked him to teach——?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Olga.</span> Yes, Oswald and Sigurd. He has been
helping them this afternoon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Liljekrona.</span> But—has he promised to give
up——?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Olga.</span> He has promised nothing. But there is
much about which he must be careful when he has to
look little children in the eyes every day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Liljekrona.</span> You’re sure he can do it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Olga.</span> (<span class="dir">Not heeding</span>) If it had not been Christmas,
perhaps I should not have ventured; but if our
Lord dared to place His own son among us sinners,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
surely we can dare to let our children try to save a
human soul.</p>

their Mother’s hand! (<span class="dir">They do so, though not
just knowing why.</span>)</p>
